### üëã Hi, This is Swechha Singh!

I'm fascinated by the field of machine learning and its potential to solve various interdisciplinary problems. I'm open to new opportunities to work on some cool and impactful ideas to solve problems in vision-language field.

I have **two** years of industry work experience building end-to-end ML systems for genomics data (single-cell RNA sequencing data). I did a professional **master's** in **Machine Learning** from [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/person/swechha/), Universit√© de Montr√©al and bachelor's in Electrical Engineering from IITK (Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur), India, in 2016.

As a part of my master's degree, I did six months internship at [Korbit AI](https://www.linkedin.com/company/korbit-ai/), an EdTech startup that is building a personalized and interactive learning platform to learn data science skills with a personal AI-powered tutor. During this internship, I worked on a **Contextual Spelling Correction** system for data science domain, and on a **recommendation system** to predict students‚Äô pause behavior in online video lectures.

Last summer, I worked on a cool side project: [Handwriting mimic app](https://youtu.be/Ghsb3w0QACI). As a part of this project, I created an end-to-end ML system from implementing an ML model to deploying a website on the AWS cloud. **Using this app, you can generate text in your own handwriting style**. The ML model used in this project is a generative model for real-valued sequence data composed of stacked LSTM layers from [‚ÄúGenerating Sequences With Recurrent Neural Networks‚Äù](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.0850.pdf) paper by Alex Graves. For more details about this project, please go to [github](https://github.com/swechhachoudhary/Handwriting-synthesis). Have fun writing some cool stuff!!

I have worked on various machine learning techniques ranging from classical Matrix Factorization to deep neural networks such as CNNs, RNNs, Auto-encoder, Transformer, etc. I've studied various graduate courses: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, NLP, and Probabilistic Graphical Models, and undergrad courses: Probability & Statistics, Linear Algebra, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Intro to C programming.

During my undergrad years, I also worked as an **Android Developer**, and after graduation, I spent ten months at Citibank, India as a **Technology Analyst**.

Apart from work, you will find me
* getting better at **dancing** (Jazz funk, K-POP)
* new hobby: puzzling
* playing board games with friends
* doing portrait sketching / landscape painting
* always in searching for the perfect ice-cream flavour
* exploring various cuisine 
* reading fiction books (currently reading Dune), The Hunger Games is my fav
* playing badminton
* <s>last but not least, Netflix</s>
